                <p>IMDb is a database of movie, TV and celebrity content designed to help people explore and be informed about the various options for movies and TV shows. People can read about movie, TV and celebrity news, rate, and share them to their peers.  </p>

                
                <p>However, IMDB's current webpage is cluttered with words and information, making it difficult to read or parse through the information. The UI is counter-intuitive to the function of the website. </p>
