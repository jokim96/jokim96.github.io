<div className=\"portfolio-dev-section1\" >\n                <h2>Context</h2>\n                <p> We chose to design an interface for the startup “Simmer”. We designed 4 different mockup wireframes and collectively created a hi-fi prototype. We took this prototype to users at Brown University to gather feedback with which improved the final prototye. This prototype was then shared on UserTesting.com to see how respondents used the products. We formed hypothesises and analyzed the quantatitive and qualititive aspects to the interactions.   </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section2\" >\n                <h2> Simmer</h2>\n\n                <p>  Simmer is a startup for an app that creates a collection of reviews of dishes. Simmer differentiates itself from Yelp or OpenTable through its focus on dishes rather than  restaurants. Simmer is an interesting user interaction experiment, as it requires some sort of incentive creation for people to be willing to user the app. There are also ways of thinking about functionalities that don’t currently exist (i.e. selecting combinations of menu items that you think complement each other well, favoriting dishes, or incorporating a newsfeed) that would be worth designing the UI for. We decided to design a mobile interface for Simmer for on-the-go ordering and browsing for food options.  </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section2\" >\n                <h2> Pre-Mock Up Questions</h2>\n\n                <p>In order to understand the users for which we are designing, we started thinking about the needs of the specific groups of people the app is impacting.</p>\n<br></br>\n                <b>What is a group of people that will be directly impacted by your interface? </b>\n            \n                <p>The users deciding what food to order and the users leaving reviews of dishes will be the main groups of people that will be directly impacted by our interface.

What are some questions that your interface should address to ethically handle these effects?</b>\n\n                <p>Bad reviews can quickly sink a company, and this can disproportionately affect smaller businesses, for whom one bad review can drastically pull down their average review score.\n\n                Uneven numbers of reviews for specific dishes in restaurant could bias users towards more reviewed dishes. \n\n                If Simmer prioritizes popular restaurants such as chains, it could overpower smaller businesses who will in turn lose more customers. \n                </p>\n<br></br>\n                <b>What is a group of people that will be directly impacted by your interface?</b>\n\n                <p>The users deciding what food to order and the users leaving reviews of dishes will be the main groups of people that will be directly impacted by our interface.
