Since the functionality of the app depends on the user’s willingness to leave a rating and/or review, we incorporated the design which makes it seem the easiest to leave a review, which was the design that had a whole page dedicated to leaving a review. We decided to have a clean home page, with options for discovering new dishes below, so if a user simply wants to search a specific dish they would be able to do so easily. The dishes all have drop shadows, to imply that it is clickable, and are formatted like stacked cards that expand when clicked upon.\n</p>\n                <div className=\"sketch-container\">\n                    <img src={(Proto1a)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1b)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1c)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1d)} />\n                </div>            \n            </div>\n\n\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section5\" >\n                <h2> Improved Prototype</h2>\n\n                <h3>Feedback and Improvements</h3>\n                <p> - Clickable items are too small -> got rid of small dropdown items\n                    <br></br>\n- Original blue color choice does not stimulate hunger -> we switched to orange <br></br>\n- Original grey font choice too light -> we made it darker <br></br>\n- Added a back button to nested screens <br></br> \n- Create previous reviews and likes pages in the profile view <br></br>\n- Created a full profile page instead of a dropdown  <br></br>\n- Removed hamburger icon which suggested it was made for desktop\n </p>\n                <br></br>\n            \n                <div className=\"sketch-container\">\n                    <img src={(Proto2d)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2a)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2b)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2c)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2e)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2f)} />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section5\" >\n                <h2> User Testing</h2>\n\n                <p>After receiving feedback on our first interactive hi-fi prototype, we created another iteration of our design and sent it out for users to test online.

Explain why and how you chose the dish.<br></br>\n                    Hypothesis: We hypothesize that users will first search “Curry” to look for a curry dish from the search bar. They will then select the dish that is both reasonable in cost and rated high. \n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Task 2: \n                    After finding the curry dish that you would buy, write a review for it\n                    <br></br>\n                    Hypothesis:We hypothesize that users will not have a difficult time finding the “Write a Review” button as it stands out with its orange color against a plain white background. We hypothesize that the time taken would be 5s\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Task 3: Find the page that lists all of your previous reviews <br></br> We hypothesize that users will be able to successfully navigate to their Account to find their personal dish review page as they would know from experience from other apps that features dedicated to themselves are usually found under an “Account” heading. We hypothesize the time taken to be 5-10s.\n                    </p>\n\n                <br></br>\n                <h3>Results</h3>\n                <br></br>\n                We tested 3 users on UserTesting.com with the above-mentioned tasks. \n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                <div id=\"results\">\n                    <p>Task 1: Our hypothesis was only met with 1 user, who used the search bar to look for curry options. They evaluated their option based on the cost, ratings and reviews. The other 2 users saw a curry option immediately on our landing page under the “Popular Dishes Near You” heading and proceeded to the dish page. Upon seeing good reviews for the dish, they selected it\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Task 2: All users could write a review with ease and did not have trouble finding how to write a review for a specific dish. They averaged a time of 4 seconds on the task.  This result matched our hypothesis.\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                    Task 3: 1 user made an error looking for the review page. They believed that they could find the page within a dish page. For the other 2 users, it was very clear and intuitive that they click the account button to navigate to their review page. The average time for the task was 8s, which was within our hypothesized time range.\n                    </p>\n                    <img src={(results)} />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section5\" >\n                <h2>Analysis and Reflection</h2>\n                <h3>Quantitative Analysis</h3>\n                <p>\n                Users were generally comfortable using their interface. They all had positive things to say about its appearance and layout, saying that it is simple and attractive and they could carry out tasks efficiently. This is also reflected by the metrics, where all users had a 100% completion rate on the tasks, and only one user made an error. This error was instantly noticed and corrected by the user. The time on task is also as expected. Task 1 took a longer time as users were describing their evaluation process for their dishes and as they browsed through the reviews for the dishes. \n                </p>\n\n                <br></br>\n\n                <h3>Potential Interface Changes</h3>\n                <p>\n                We propose a few minor interface changes based off some feedback given by the users. One user reported that it could be convenient to have a “Favorite” feature for dishes so that they could reference their top dishes on the go. We propose that we could add a bookmark button within each dish page to allow a user to favorite a dish, and a button on the top left corner of the app for a quick reference to a list of favorite dishes.  \n                </p>\n\n\n                <br></br>\n\n                <h3>Reflection</h3>\n                <p>\n                We believe that the user testing experience was extremely successful. We started our app design with a concept that we believed was intuitive and easy to use. However, by testing with users, both live and online, we realized that there was plenty of room for improvement and was able to iterate to develop an app with a more pleasant user experience that maximizes user’s ability to browse and clickability. We learnt to be open to the ideas of others and to think critically about everyone’s comments. We also learnt to that we need to critically evaluate how we ask our questions to users in order to draw out constructive criticisms from them. \n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n\n\n            </div>\n        </Page>\n    )\n  }\n  \n\nexport default Development;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
