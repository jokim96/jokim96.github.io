“Simmer”. We designed 4 different mockup wireframes and collectively created a hi-fi prototype. We took this prototype to users at Brown University to gather feedback with which improved the final prototye. This prototype was then shared on UserTesting.com to see how respondents used the products. We formed hypothesises and analyzed the quantatitive and qualititive aspects to the interactions.   </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section2\" >\n                <h2> Simmer</h2>\n\n                <p>  Simmer is a startup for an app that creates a collection of reviews of dishes. Simmer differentiates itself from Yelp or OpenTable through its focus on dishes rather than  restaurants. Simmer is an interesting user interaction experiment, as it requires some sort of incentive creation for people to be willing to user the app. There are also ways of thinking about functionalities that don’t currently exist (i.e. selecting combinations of menu items that you think complement each other well, favoriting dishes, or incorporating a newsfeed) that would be worth designing the UI for. We decided to design a mobile interface for Simmer for on-the-go ordering and browsing for food options.  </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section2\" >\n                <h2> Pre-Mock Up Questions</h2>\n\n                <p>In order to understand the users for which we are designing, we started thinking about the needs of the specific groups of people the app is impacting.</p>\n<br></br>\n                <b>What is a group of people that will be directly impacted by your interface? </b>\n            \n                <p>The users deciding what food to order and the users leaving reviews of dishes will be the main groups of people that will be directly impacted by our interface.

What are some questions that your interface should address to ethically handle these effects?</b>\n\n                <p>Bad reviews can quickly sink a company, and this can disproportionately affect smaller businesses, for whom one bad review can drastically pull down their average review score.\n\n                Uneven numbers of reviews for specific dishes in restaurant could bias users towards more reviewed dishes. \n\n                If Simmer prioritizes popular restaurants such as chains, it could overpower smaller businesses who will in turn lose more customers. \n                </p>\n<br></br>\n                <b>What is a group of people that will be directly impacted by your interface?</b>\n\n                <p>The users deciding what food to order and the users leaving reviews of dishes will be the main groups of people that will be directly impacted by our interface.

Since the functionality of the app depends on the user’s willingness to leave a rating and/or review, we incorporated the design which makes it seem the easiest to leave a review, which was the design that had a whole page dedicated to leaving a review. We decided to have a clean home page, with options for discovering new dishes below, so if a user simply wants to search a specific dish they would be able to do so easily. The dishes all have drop shadows, to imply that it is clickable, and are formatted like stacked cards that expand when clicked upon.\n</p>\n                <div className=\"sketch-container\">\n                    <img src={(Proto1a)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1b)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1c)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto1d)} />\n                </div>            \n            </div>\n\n\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section5\" >\n                <h2> Improved Prototype</h2>\n\n                <h3>Feedback and Improvements</h3>\n                <p> - Clickable items are too small -> got rid of small dropdown items\n                    <br></br>\n- Original blue color choice does not stimulate hunger -> we switched to orange <br></br>\n- Original grey font choice too light -> we made it darker <br></br>\n- Added a back button to nested screens <br></br> \n- Create previous reviews and likes pages in the profile view <br></br>\n- Created a full profile page instead of a dropdown  <br></br>\n- Removed hamburger icon which suggested it was made for desktop\n </p>\n                <br></br>\n            \n                <div className=\"sketch-container\">\n                    <img src={(Proto2d)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2a)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2b)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2c)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2e)} />\n                    <img src={(Proto2f)} />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n\n            <div className=\"portfolio-dev-section5\" >\n                <h2> User Testing</h2>\n\n                <p>After receiving feedback on our first interactive hi-fi prototype, we created another iteration of our design and sent it out for users to test online.

We hypothesize the time taken to be 5-10s.\n                    </p>\n\n                <br></br>\n                <h3>Results</h3>\n                <div id=\"results\">\n                    <p>Task 1: Our hypothesis was only met with 1 user, who used the search bar to look for curry options. They evaluated their option based on the cost, ratings and reviews. The other 2 users saw a curry option immediately on our landing page under the “Popular Dishes Near You” heading and proceeded to the dish page.

This is also reflected by the metrics, where all users had a 100% completion rate on the tasks, and only one user made an error. This error was instantly noticed and corrected by the user. The time on task is also as expected.

One user reported that it could be convenient to have a “Favorite” feature for dishes so that they could reference their top dishes on the go. We propose that we could add a bookmark button within each dish page to allow a user to favorite a dish, and a button on the top left corner of the app for a quick reference to a list of favorite dishes.  \n                </p>\n\n\n            </div>\n\n\n            </div>\n        </Page>\n    )\n  }\n  \n\nexport default Development;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
